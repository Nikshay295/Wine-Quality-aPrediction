# Wine Quality Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties such as alcohol, pH, acidity, and sulphates. It supports quality control processes in wine production by identifying the most influential attributes contributing to high-quality wines.

## Project Summary

- Transformed raw wine data into binary classification (good or bad quality).
- Performed EDA to explore feature distributions and correlations.
- Standardized features and handled class imbalance.
- Trained and compared multiple classification models:
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - XGBoost

- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report

## Key Results

- Achieved up to **92% accuracy** using Random Forest.
- Alcohol and sulphates were identified as strong predictors of wine quality.
- Feature importance plots provided clear interpretability.

## Files Included

- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb.pdf` â€“ PDF version of the notebook/code  
- `Wine_Quality_Project_Overview.docx` â€“ Summary of code logic and workflow

## Tools Used

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
